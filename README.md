# Historical & Mathematical Aspects 

Tic Tac Toe traces back to ancicent civilizations. Versions of the game were played in Egypt around 1300 BC and in Rome around the first century BC. It's popularity comes from its simplicity and accessibility, requiring only a grid and two players.

Tic Tac Toe is a solved game, meaning that with perfect play from both sides, the result is always a draw. Mathematically, it illustrates game theory, combinatorics, and algorithms. 

This game shows how mathematics and history intesects even in the simplest pastimes. 

Features: 
- Interactive 3*3 grid
- Turn-based play between X and O
- Win detection and game status updates
